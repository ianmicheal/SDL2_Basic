# SDL2_Basic
This is a fork of [SDL_BASIC](https://github.com/dashxdr/SDL_basic) that also includes an `sdl1` branch. There is an patched update of that branch [here](https://github.com/paulwratt/pistol_Basic/tree/SDL_Basic+patches) that brings it (almost) inline with the original after the SDL2 transition.

# Usage
Read the [README](README).
